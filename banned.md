    > Hi I'm the developer of u/old-reddit-fmt-bot. I just got I message that it was banned from r/linux for "botbusted!".

    > I have a feeling this ban was due to an automated system and I'd just like to confirm that the mods meant to do that.

    > 1. This bot is clearly labeled as a bot. Each post links to an information page about the bot. It's behavior is obviously botlike.
    > 2. It targets a very short list of subreddits (currently 4 including r/linux). It replies to comments about specific behavior relevant to those subreddits (problematic code block formatting).
    > 3. It tries to be very polite. It has somewhat sophisticated [logic](https://github.com/singron/old-reddit-fmt-bot/issues/1) to ignore minor superficial formatting issues and it edits its own comments when it detects the author has fixed the code block formatting of their comment.
    > 4. It has fairly low volume. Across 4 subreddits over the last 7 days it's made 2.7 comments per day.
    > 5. I think it's fairly well liked. It seems to be upvoted much more than downvoted and the "good bots" outnumber the "bad bots".
* I was muted from r/linux for 72 hours at 2019-09-04T20:53:45.
